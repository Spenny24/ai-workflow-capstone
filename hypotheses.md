Testable hypotheses

1) Revenue in month t+1 depends on core activity in month t â€” purchases, stream views, and active customers by country.
2) Seasonal lift exists in Q4. I expect November and December to outperform other months.
3) Country mix matters. The top revenue countries should explain most of the variation month to month.
4) Churn and reactivation are visible in activity dips and spikes. A short list of rolling features should help surface this.

Why these help management
Accurate month-ahead revenue lets managers set budget and hiring with less guesswork, especially during peak periods and for country-level plans.
